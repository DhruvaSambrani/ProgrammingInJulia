# Programming In Julia

This is an attempt to introduce Julia to students as a first/second language.
Inspired from the MS18 #discussion channel, which will hopefully take off well.

## Class 0 - Installing Julia - 7th October

Intro pre-recorded video which introduces Julia, Pluto, Plots. Recommended for those who don't know Julia. Those who have done some basic Julia can skip. Or watch at 2x and give feedback. [Class 0](./Class 0)

## Class 1 - Computational Structuring in Julia - not fixed

Learn how to break down a big problem into much smaller problems, which you can solve simply. Also learn how giving code structure speeds up coding while also adding scalability.

## Tips

If you wanna speed up the video without downloading it

1. open video in a new tab
2. Press `ctrl-shift-I`
3. Then in the `Elements` tab, click the `<video ...>` tag, so that a `$0` can be seen next to it.
4. Then in the `Console` tab, type in `$0.playbackRate=1.5` or whatever speed.

**Hope you enjoy!!!**
