# Programming In Julia

This is an attempt to introduce Julia to students as a first/second language.
Inspired from the MS18 #discussion channel, which will hopefully take off well.

## Class 0 - Installing Julia - 7th October

Intro pre-recorded video which introduces Julia, Pluto, Plots. Recommended for those who don't know Julia. Those who have done some basic Julia can skip. Or watch at 2x and give feedback. [Class 0](./Class 0)

## Class 1 - Computational Structuring in Julia - 9th October

So as a start of the discussion sessions in PM-18, I'm conducting an Introduction to Julia using N-Body Simulations interactive session on Friday 9th Oct, 4pm.

I'll start off by looking at the question physically, and then go ahead to write code to simulate it. I am going to be using Julia, and urge you to do the same. See Class 0 above. However, logic is language-agnostic, and you can use any of your choice.

What you'll learn (apart from coding)-

- Why Physics questions are basically Computational problems
- How to build a universe from the smallest components
- How to think of interactions between objects
- How cats and planets are related.

I'll send the Zoom link just before the thing starts on the discord group and here.

## Tips

If you wanna speed up the recorded videos without downloading it

1. open video in a new tab
2. Press `ctrl-shift-I`
3. Then in the `Elements` tab, click the `<video ...>` tag, so that a `$0` can be seen next to it.
4. Then in the `Console` tab, type in `$0.playbackRate=1.5` or whatever speed.

**Hope you enjoy!!!**
